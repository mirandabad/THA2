**Research Question:** Is there any relation between school districts types, retention rates, and dropout rates in Texas public schools?

The three data sources used are all from the Texas Education Agency (TEA)'s [website](https://tea.texas/gov/).
> - The first data source is a spreadsheet of [Texas Public School Districts Categorized by Type, for the 2016-17 academic year](https://tea.texas.gov/acctres/analyze/1617/district1617.html). TEA classifies public school districts into [9 different types](https://tea.texas.gov/acctres/analyze/1617/level.html): major urban, major suburban, other central city, other central city suburban, independent town, non-metropolitan: fast growing, non-metropolitan: stable, rural, and charter school districts.
> - The second data source contains [grade-level retention rates](https://tea.texas.gov/acctres/retention/1617/level.html) for Texas public schools during the 2016-2017 academic year. The numbers are broken down by grade and school district.
> - The third data source contains [dropout data](https://tea.texas.gov/acctres/drop_annual/1617/level.html) for grades 7-12 in Texas public schools during the 2016-2017 academic year.
> - *Note: All of the above data sets have been downloaded and saved as "data1.xls," "data2.xlsx," and "data3.xlsx" respectively. Merged data includes Texas Retention and Dropout Rates, 2016-2017 (i.e., "data2.xlsx" and "data3.xlsx").*
